## Description

"Veerpal's Portfolio" is a project, which was created with a framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page- Bootstrap. With this challenge, I would like to show my projects, information about me, my skills, how I can be contacted and external links leading to my resume and portfolio.
 This weekly activity targets particular skills, which I developed by this point - accessibility, flexbox, media queries,CSS variables and using Bootstrap.
